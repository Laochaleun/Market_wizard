v0.4.0 (2026-01-31)
- Integrated GUS 2024 data for Income Levels: 5 new categories (Very Low to Very High) based on official decile/quintile net income ranges.
- Integrated GUS 2024 data for Location/Urbanization: 5 new categories (Rural, Small City, Medium City, Large City, Metropolis) with accurate population weights (~41% rural, ~13% metropolis).
- Updated "Gender" dropdown in Polish interface to use "K" (Kobieta) instead of "F".
- Added `test_personas.py` to verify statistical distribution of occupations, incomes, and locations against GUS benchmarks.
- Refined backend logic to use new granular location and income data for more realistic persona generation.

v0.3.7 (2026-01-31)
- Finalized HF download fix by caching exports in Gradio's cache and returning the cached files via `gr.File`, letting Gradio itself serve `/file=...`.
- Removed custom `/download-report` route in favor of Gradio's native file serving, which avoids HF proxy restrictions.
- Clarified session notes and logs to document the resolved flow (cache copy + __sign handling).

v0.3.6 (2026-01-31)
- Fixed download endpoint routing by mounting Gradio into FastAPI and serving files via a dedicated `/download-report/{filename}` route.
- Export links now use request-aware absolute URLs (base_url / forwarded headers) to play nicely with proxies.
- Added targeted logging around download URL construction and Gradio mount for easier HF debugging.

v0.3.5 (2026-01-31)
- Fixed Hugging Face deployment: Added missing system dependencies (Pango, Cairo, etc.) and Python packages (WeasyPrint, Pandas, pytz).
- Enabled full Playwright support in Docker (Chromium + system dependencies).
- Fixed "File wasn't available on site" error on Hugging Face by relocating report exports to a local 'reports/' directory and configuring Gradio 'allowed_paths'.
- Updated local setup (run.sh) to automatically handle Playwright browser installation.
- Added logging and write permission handling (chmod 777) for persistent report storage on server.
- Synced GitHub (origin) and Hugging Face (hf) repositories for consistent deployment.

v0.3.0 (2026-01-30)
- Overhauled report analysis prompts (PL/EN) for deeper, literal, data-anchored insights and enforced suffixes on recommendations.
- Increased default report analysis max output tokens to 16384.
- Added sanitize pass using the same model to neutralize style and remove storytelling artifacts.
- Enforced recommendation suffixes server-side with automatic validation.
- Added report analysis sanitize cache refresh (v3) in frontend pipeline.

v0.2.0 (2026-01-30)
- Added narrative analysis sections to reports (narrative, agent response summary, sales/marketing recommendations).
- Report analysis now uses Gemini 3 Pro Preview with explicit thinking budget configuration.
- PDF export uses browser rendering (Playwright) for closer HTML parity (fallback to WeasyPrint).
- Web search defaults enabled for simulations, A/B, price analysis, and focus group; sources reused in price analysis.
- Focus group optionally injects market context from cached/search sources.
- Report HTML print layout improvements (avoid page breaks in charts).
- Added report analysis debugging logs.
- Bug fixes for report analysis caching and export regeneration.
- URL extraction flow improvements: visible “Fetch from URL” button with in-flight status and stricter URL detection.
- URL normalization now accepts www.* inputs and uses https:// automatically.
- Reuse extracted URL data across simulation, price analysis, and focus group without re-fetching.
- Persist extracted URL data in projects and reload on project load.
