v0.3.0 (2026-01-30)
- Added narrative analysis sections to reports (narrative, agent response summary, sales/marketing recommendations).
- Report analysis now uses Gemini 3 Pro Preview with explicit thinking budget configuration.
- PDF export uses browser rendering (Playwright) for closer HTML parity (fallback to WeasyPrint).
- Web search defaults enabled for simulations, A/B, price analysis, and focus group; sources reused in price analysis.
- Focus group optionally injects market context from cached/search sources.
- Report HTML print layout improvements (avoid page breaks in charts).
- Added report analysis debugging logs.
- Bug fixes for report analysis caching and export regeneration.
- URL extraction flow improvements: visible “Fetch from URL” button with in-flight status and stricter URL detection.
- URL normalization now accepts www.* inputs and uses https:// automatically.
- Reuse extracted URL data across simulation, price analysis, and focus group without re-fetching.
- Persist extracted URL data in projects and reload on project load.

Known issue:
- Gemini 3 Pro Preview sometimes returns empty text in API unless thinking_budget is set; analysis can still fail on some runs.

v0.3.1 (2026-01-30)
- Overhauled report analysis prompts (PL/EN) for deeper, literal, data-anchored insights and enforced suffixes on recommendations.
- Increased default report analysis max output tokens to 16384.
- Added sanitize pass using the same model to neutralize style and remove storytelling artifacts.
- Enforced recommendation suffixes server-side with automatic validation.
- Added report analysis sanitize cache refresh (v3) in frontend pipeline.
