v0.3.0 (2026-01-30)
- Added narrative analysis sections to reports (narrative, agent response summary, sales/marketing recommendations).
- Report analysis now uses Gemini 3 Pro Preview with explicit thinking budget configuration.
- PDF export uses browser rendering (Playwright) for closer HTML parity (fallback to WeasyPrint).
- Web search defaults enabled for simulations, A/B, price analysis, and focus group; sources reused in price analysis.
- Focus group optionally injects market context from cached/search sources.
- Report HTML print layout improvements (avoid page breaks in charts).
- Added report analysis debugging logs.
- Bug fixes for report analysis caching and export regeneration.

Known issue:
- Gemini 3 Pro Preview sometimes returns empty text in API unless thinking_budget is set; analysis can still fail on some runs.
