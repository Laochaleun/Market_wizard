v0.5.5 (2026-02-07) - Stage 1 calibration framework and external validation
- Switched runtime SSR defaults to match calibration training setup:
  - `SSR_TEMPERATURE=1.0` in `backend/app/config.py` and `backend/.env.example`.

- Integrated domain-aware calibration in scoring path:
  - `SSREngine` now accepts `domain_hint` and routes calibration via policy/default calibrator.
  - `SimulationEngine` passes `domain_hint="ecommerce"` to SSR scoring.
- Extended hierarchical tuning script to include calibration validation:
  - OOF validation (`--calibration-cv-folds`),
  - holdout validation (`--calibration-holdout-ratio`),

- Added domain calibration policy builder:
  - `backend/scripts/build_domain_calibration_policy.py`
  - supports domain-specific fitting (`general`, `ecommerce`) and `--optimize {mae,off1}`.
- Added production-readiness validation suite:
  - `backend/scripts/validate_production_readiness.py`
  - evaluates external datasets (Amazon 2023, Yelp, App Reviews, Allegro),

  - compares calibration policies (`raw`, `global`, blends, domain policy artifact).
- Added/updated tests:
  - `backend/tests/test_score_calibration.py`
  - `backend/tests/test_ssr_engine.py` (raw vs calibrated and domain-hint routing)
- Stage 1 outcome:
  - best policy on current benchmark: `ecommerce_only_calibrated`,
  - production gates still not met (`Decision: FAIL`) on `reports/production_readiness_validation_2026-02-07.md`.

v0.5.4 (2026-02-07)
- Added post-SSR calibration validation workflow in `backend/scripts/tune_ssr_hierarchical.py`:

  - `backend/scripts/validate_grouped_ratings_csv.py` (CSV validator for grouped labeled data)
  - `backend/scripts/build_poland_grouped_csv.py` (Polish grouped dataset builder)
  - `backend/scripts/ssr_grouped_ratings_template.csv` (input template)
- Added benchmark reports for large-scale tuning and hybrid PL+industry runs:

- Unified environment templates and removed duplication:
  - kept `backend/.env.example` as canonical template,
  - removed `backend/.env.sample`,
  - updated README setup command accordingly.
- This commit is intentionally marked as a rollback-safe point before calibration work.

- Refined backend logic to use new granular location and income data for more realistic persona generation.

v0.3.7 (2026-01-31)
- Finalized HF download fix by caching exports in Gradio's cache and returning the cached files via `gr.File`, letting Gradio itself serve `/file=...`.
- Removed custom `/download-report` route in favor of Gradio's native file serving, which avoids HF proxy restrictions.
- Clarified session notes and logs to document the resolved flow (cache copy + __sign handling).

v0.3.6 (2026-01-31)
- Fixed download endpoint routing by mounting Gradio into FastAPI and serving files via a dedicated `/download-report/{filename}` route.

- Fixed "File wasn't available on site" error on Hugging Face by relocating report exports to a local 'reports/' directory and configuring Gradio 'allowed_paths'.
- Updated local setup (run.sh) to automatically handle Playwright browser installation.
- Added logging and write permission handling (chmod 777) for persistent report storage on server.
- Synced GitHub (origin) and Hugging Face (hf) repositories for consistent deployment.
